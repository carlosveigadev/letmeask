# **Let me Ask**

This is a project developed at NWL 6, where is learned react and firebase to develop a website for streamers to create rooms where you are able to answer your audience's questions in real-time.

The main objective of this project was to improve the use of TypeScript, React and Firebase. I also used custom hooks and added proper linters for the project.

## **Built With**
- React
- Google Authentication
- Firebase (Database and Deploy)
